# Introduction

<!-- TODO -->


This project was developed to compose the grade of the second unit of the discipline of programming language I.

For this it was necessary to develop a game, in this case, the hangman, whose objective is to find the missing word or words. For this, you must follow the following rules:

  [1] You need to guess the secret word or phrase the game has chosen
      by suggesting letters.
      
  [2] We will display a row of dashes, representing each letter of the
      the secret word/phrase you're trying to guess.
      
  [3] Each correct guess earns you 1 point.
      
  [4] if you repeat the letter you lose 1 point.
  
  [5] If you wrong guess 6 times you loose the challenge.
  
  [6] If you can guess the secret word/phrase before the hangman is
      complete you add 2 extra points to your overall score.
      
  [7] After a guessing round (challenge) is complete you may try another
      secret word/phrase or quit the game.
