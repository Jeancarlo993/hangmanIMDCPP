  [1] You need to guess the secret word or phrase the game has chosen
      by suggesting letters.
  [2] We will display a row of dashes, representing each letter of the
      the secret word/phrase you're trying to guess.
  [3] Each correct guess earns you 1 point.
  [4] Each wrong guess you loose 1 point and I draw on component of a
      hanged stick figure (the hangman!).
  [5] if you repeat the letter you lose 1 point.
  [6] If you wrong guess 6 times you loose the challenge.
  [7] If you can guess the secret word/phrase before the hangman is
      complete you add 2 extra points to your overall score.
  [8] After a guessing round (challenge) is complete you may try another
      secret word/phrase or quit the game.
